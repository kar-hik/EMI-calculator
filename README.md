# EMI-calculator

This project reads a CSV file with loans and stores the header file and body separately and they are monitored by a list which manages all the dictionary.
And created a file with all the EMI calculated for the loans. And it adds the content of the file to the previously created file with header EMI. So that it can read any number of loans and gives the EMI calculated.
